Postgraduate Researcher @ University of Bologna, currently working at the EEESLab. In March 2025 I graduated with honours from the Master's Degree in Artificial Intelligence, with a thesis on Federated Neural Graphics Primitives on Nanodrones, proving the possibilities of deploying a complex network like NeRF on microcontrollers, work I carried on in collaboration both with the EEESLab and the Nanorobotics Research Group @ IDSIA, Lugano, Switzerland. Previously, I have completed a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering, graduating with honours in 2022.
