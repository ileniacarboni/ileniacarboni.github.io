<!-- Postgraduate AI Research Fellow at the University of Bologna, working on embedding Neural Radiance Fields on swarms of nano-UAVs for onboard scene reconstruction and navigation. 

Graduated with honors in 2025 from the Master's Degree in Artificial Intelligence from the same institution, with a Research Thesis in collaboration with the Nanorobotics Research Group (Dalle Molle Institute for Artificial Intelligence, Lugano, Switzerland). 

Previously, graduated with honors in 2022 from the Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering, with an internship and thesis focused on Novel View Synthesis and Computer Vision. -->

I'm a Postgraduate AI Research Fellow at the University of Bologna, working at the intersection between Computer Vision, Autonomous Robotics and Embedded Systems. 

My research currently focuses on enabling real-time, onboard 3D scene reconstruction and navigation on ultra-low-power microcontrollers - advancing autonomous robotics in constrained environments.

I completed my Master's Degree in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Bologna in 2025, graduating with highest honors. 
My thesis, conducted in collaboration with the Nanorobotics Research Group at the Dalle Molle Institute for Artificial Intelligence (IDSIA) in Switzerland, explored _"Federated Neural Radiance Fields on a Swarm of Miniaturized Robots"_. 
This experience included a rewarding research stay abroad, supported by a merit-based scholarship.

Before that, I earned my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering, also with honors, where I focused on Novel View Synthesis and Computer Vision during my internship and thesis projects.

Feel free to explore my work and get in touch if you'd like to collaborate!
